Final Project Assessment : MoodTracker
Course :  Object Oriented Programming in Java ( Cursera - IBM ) 

Welcome to the final project for Object-Oriented Programming in Java. In this project, you will apply the knowledge and skills acquired in this course to a simulated scenario.

In this assignment, you will create a console application for a mood-tracking application, which will allow you to create a Mood object with attributes, name, date, time, and notes. The tasks in this hands-on project correspond to the activities performed by a Java developer creating a standalone console application.

You are currently viewing this lab in a cloud-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE). It is a fully online development environment that comes pre-installed with JDK 21, allowing you to code, develop, and learn all in one place.


Learning Objectives

-> Create classes and objects using OOP concepts such as encapsulation and polymorphism
-> Use collections to store objects in memory
-> Create, store, retrieve, and manipulate Date and Time objects
-> Handle File Input/Output
